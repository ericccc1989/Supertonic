## Iteration from mockup

1) Add button changes in Plan pages' Kanban board. 
User now can create each task from only 1 add button on top left corner. This is a easier way to access popup window compared with multiple add buttons in different columns.

2) Metronome UI update.
A direct metronome player interface is better than a metronome icon leading to a new pop page. A pop up metronome window may cover the stopwatch, it is inconvenient for user to adjust the bpm while seeing the stopwatch at the same times.

3) Stopwatch button
A fully working stopwatch need controls including reset, start and stop. The mockup version didnt consider this, thus I add additional button to make it work in a reasonable way.
